# Bootstrap

Within this module I have learned how to use bootstrap which includes Bootstrat basics, documentation, verson selection, source code.

Also I have come acrose with  inbuilt functionality such as Mobile-First approach, Core CSS, Grid system and responsive design.

Using all above functionality I have manage to creat Whiskey Drop Service pages which are well rendored with responsive design to all different resolutions.

Further more, I have learned how to impose our own CSS coding on top of Bootstrap code to makeover of website i norder to make it look better than others and style better which is unique rather than falling in copycat catagory.
